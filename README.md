**ExternalVideo** is a MediaWiki extension for embedding videos from external providers into MediaWiki. Whilst there are some extensions to embed videos in MediaWiki, these do not fit our needs.

Namely, we wanted a way to natively embed these videos in MediaWiki galleries. Extension:Video does this by adding its own `<videogallery>` tag, but this does not allow mixing with regular images, and that extension is not stable.

ExternalVideo is also planned to display the videos on their respective file pages, rather than creating a new special page.

> Note: This extension is currently under development and is not suitable for production use.
